# Tracker: GitHub Issues

This tracker uses GitHub Issues for specs and task tracking.

## Step 1: Spec

**Where to record**: GitHub Issue description

Example issue body for `#42: User Authentication`:

```markdown
## Problem

Users cannot log in to the application. We need a secure authentication system.

## Proposed Solution

Implement JWT-based authentication with email/password login.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] User can log in and receive a JWT token
- [ ] Protected routes reject requests without valid token
- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt

## Non-Goals

- Social login (OAuth) — future work
- Password reset — future work
```

## Step 2: Plan

**Where to record**: GitHub Issue description (append)

Append the implementation plan to the issue:

```markdown
---

## Implementation Plan

Status: DRAFT

### Tasks

- [ ] 1. Add User model and migrations
- [ ] 2. Add password hashing utilities (depends on 1)
- [ ] 3. Add /register endpoint (depends on 1, 2)
- [ ] 4. Add /login endpoint with JWT (depends on 1, 2)
- [ ] 5. Add auth middleware (depends on 4)
- [ ] 6. Protect routes with middleware (depends on 5)

### Notes

- Using PyJWT for tokens
- Token expiry: 24 hours
```

**Approval mechanism**:
- In interactive mode, user approves verbally (agent proceeds immediately)
- In headless mode:
  1. Update issue with plan, set `Status: DRAFT`
  2. Add comment: "Implementation plan ready for review"
  3. Output `<AWAITING_APPROVAL>`
  4. User approves by changing to `Status: APPROVED` — missing status is treated as DRAFT

## Step 3: Task

**Tracking progress**: Check off tasks in the issue as you complete them.

Example progress:
```markdown
- [x] 1. Add User model and migrations
- [x] 2. Add password hashing utilities
- [ ] 3. Add /register endpoint ← IN PROGRESS
- [ ] 4. Add /login endpoint with JWT
```

## Step 4: Ship

**PR reference**: Link PR to issue using `Closes #42` in PR description.

## Step 5: Feedback

**On BLOCKED**:
- Add a comment explaining the blocker
- Add `blocked` label if available

## Step 6: Cleanup

**After merge**: GitHub auto-closes the issue if PR used `Closes #42`.

## Local vs Remote: The Hybrid Approach

**Draft locally, publish when done. Track progress remotely.**

| Artifact | Where to draft | Where to publish | Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Spec | `.claude/draft-spec.md` | GitHub Issue body | Push when interview/spec complete |
| Plan | `.claude/draft-plan.md` | GitHub Issue body | Push when plan approved |
| Task progress | — | GitHub Issue checkboxes | Track ONLY in issue, not locally |

**Why this approach**:
- Drafting locally allows iteration without spamming issue history
- Git history on drafts is valuable for complex features
- Task progress in issue = single source of truth for status
- Anyone (human or agent) can check issue to see current state

**Workflow**:
1. Draft spec locally during `/interview` or Step 1
2. When spec is ready, push to issue body
3. Draft plan locally during Step 2
4. When plan is approved, push to issue body
5. Track task completion ONLY by checking boxes in the issue
