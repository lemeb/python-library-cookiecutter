# go-on-loop.sh — Autonomous loop wrapper for /go-on
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev/go-on-loop.sh ISSUE-123              # Run until blocked/complete
#   ./dev/go-on-loop.sh ISSUE-123 50           # Max 50 iterations
#   ./dev/go-on-loop.sh ISSUE-123 50 900       # Wait 15min (900s) after PR
#
# The loop continues on <STEP_COMPLETE> and stops on other signals.
# After submitting a PR (<AWAITING_REVIEW>), it waits for CI/review before
# checking for feedback.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Feature complete or awaiting human action
#   1 - Blocked (needs intervention)
#   2 - Max iterations reached
#
# Future enhancement: "work queue" mode where the loop picks the next
# unblocked issue from a list when the current one is blocked.
