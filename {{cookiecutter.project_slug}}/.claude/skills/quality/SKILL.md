# All Quality Gates

## When to Use

- **After parallel sub-agents**: Run this to verify nothing was missed due to
  concurrent edits
- **As all-in-one check**: If not using parallel sub-agents, this runs everything

## Procedure

1. Run all quality gate commands sequentially:
   ```
   make check-fix
   make check
   make check-strict-all
   make test-with-coverage
   make doc
   ```

2. If any fail, fix the issues and re-run from step 1

3. Report detailed status summary:
