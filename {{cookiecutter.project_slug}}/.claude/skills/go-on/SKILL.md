description: Continue the implementation workflow from wherever it was left off. Executes ONE atomic unit of work, then exits cleanly. Use to make incremental progress on a feature.

# Workflow Continuation

Load `AGENTS.md` to understand the full workflow and current project conventions.

## Procedure

1. **Assess current state** from external sources:
   - Check for spec (issue tracker, conversation, or docs)
   - Check for implementation plan and task breakdown
   - Check git for branch, commits, uncommitted changes
   - Check filesystem for implementation progress

2. **Identify next action** based on state:

   | State | Action |
   |-------|--------|
   | No spec exists | Write spec, update tracking, EXIT |
   | No plan/tasks | Write plan, present to user, wait for approval, EXIT |
   | Plan approved but tasks not tracked | Create task entries, EXIT |
   | Incomplete task exists | Implement ONE task, run `/quality`, commit, mark done, EXIT |
   | All tasks done, no PR | Create PR, EXIT |
   | PR exists | Report completion, EXIT |

3. **Execute that ONE action**

4. **Update tracking** (issue tracker, git, task list)

5. **Exit with clear status**:
   ```
   ## /go-on Status

   Previous state: <what was found>
   Action taken: <what was done>
   New state: <what changed>
   Next step: <what should happen next>
   ```

## Key Principles

- **Stateless**: Determines state fresh each time from files/git/tracking
- **One atomic unit**: Does ONE thing per invocation
- **Idempotent**: Safe if interrupted; next invocation re-assesses

## Exit Conditions

- **Success**: Completed one unit of work
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed (waiting for approval, dependency)
- **Complete**: Feature done, PR created
- **Error**: Something went wrong, needs human intervention
