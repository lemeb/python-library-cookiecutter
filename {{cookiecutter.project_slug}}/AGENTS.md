# Coding agent instructions for `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`

## Good coding practices

- **Step-by-step**:
  - When coding a feature, try to break it down into smaller steps. This will
    help you focus on one thing at a time, and will make it easier to debug
    issues.
  - In practice, it means that you should operate roughly thusly:
    1. Create the directory and files needed for the feature (and ONLY those
       files.) Maybe update `.gitignore` if needed.
    2. Add the dependencies needed for the feature (and ONLY those
       dependencies.)
    3. Write the code for the feature (and ONLY that code.)
    4. Run the tests with `make test-all` and make sure they pass.
    5. Run `make test-with-coverage` to see which parts of the code are not
       covered by unit tests (without overwriting `make test-all` coverage).
       Then...
    6. Write the tests for the feature (and ONLY those tests.) As a general
       rule, we want 100% coverage WITHOUT any internet / latency request. These
       tests should be triggered with `make test`. HOWEVER, if the feature
       actually requires internet access or latency (e.g. because it is a LLM
       call), then add a test in the `tests/integration` folder that will be
       triggered with `make test-all`. In this case, you should still aim for
       two tests: one that mocks the internet / latency request (so that it can
       be run with `make test`), and one that actually does the internet /
       latency request (so that it can be run with `make test-all`.)
    7. Run the tests and make sure they pass. Note that, for now, `make test`
       does not run coverage; use `make test-with-coverage` to track unit test
       coverage without rerunning integration tests.
    8. Run again `make test-with-coverage` until you reach 100% coverage. If you
       want to make an exception to that rule, you HAVE to ask the user.
    9. Run `make check-strict-all` to make sure there are no linting or
       type-checking errors.
    10. Document the feature (and ONLY that documentation, although you might to
        update / refactor other documentation as needed.). If you create a new
        module, you MUST create a corresponding file in `docs/api/` AND update
        the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml` to include it. Don't forget to run
        `make doc`! This will catch spelling errors - add any new technical
        terms to `project-words.txt`. Also, if you think documentation would be
        improved by adding things like tutorials, guides, etc, please propose
        them to the user. If you see that one of the existing guides or
        tutorials needs to be updated, please do so proactively and properly.
    11. **Final verification**: Run `make test && make check-strict-all &&
        make doc` to ensure everything passes before proposing commits.
    12. Propose a git commit with a clear message explaining what you did. DO
        NOT COMMIT directly. Oftentimes, it makes sense to split the work into
        multiple commits. In this case, propose multiple commits with clear
        messages.
  - This is only a guideline, not a strict rule. Use your best judgment. But in
    general, we want git commits to be clean and self-contained.

## Good Python practices

- **Adding dependencies**:
  - Always add new dependencies using `uv add <package>`. This will ensure
    proper locking of the dependencies.
  - If you need to add a dev dependency, use `uv add --dev <package>`.
  - Corollary: never modify `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` directly as far as
    dependencies are concerned. Always use `uv` commands.
  - Only add dependencies that are strictly necessary. Yes, you might think that
    some packages will need to be added later. Well, wait until later then.

- **Checking code**:
  - Use `make check-fix` to format code and auto-fix lint errors, then
    `make check` to run all linting and type checks in parallel. All errors will
    be shown (the Makefile uses `-k` to keep going on failures). For stricter
    checks, use `make check-strict-all`.
  - One quirk of `make check-strict-all` is that it will run `ruff`'s preview
    rules. If you want to comment such rule out, you cannot do it in the file;
    it will be removed by `ruff format`. Instead, you should update the
    `ruff-strict.toml` file where these exceptions are documented. YOU SHOULD
    DOCUMENT THE RULE PER FILE, NOT FOR THE ENTIRE CODEBASE. And every exception
    should be documented with a comment explaining why the rule is not applied
    in that file.
  - If you're wondering if a rule is in preview: if it appears during
    `make check-strict-all`, but not during `make check`, then it is a preview
    rule. This means that you need to comment it out in `ruff-strict.toml` if
    you want to ignore it.
  - Be **really** weary before adding any `# type: ignore`, `# pyright: ignore`,
    or `# noqa` comments. These should be used only as last resort, when no
    better solution is available. Don't hesitate to ask questions to the user on
    whether further code changes are made to avoid these comments, or whether
    the ignore comments are acceptable.

- **Code practices**:
  - Check `pyproject.toml` to know what is the minimum Python version that is
    supported. Write constructs accordingly (e.g. no `Union` if Python 3.10+ is
    supported).
  - Try not to use `print` statements. Use your best judgment instead: if it's
    for logging, use `logging`. If it's for user-facing interaction, use the
    `rich` library (such as `print` or `Console`).
  - You can use `# type: ignore[error-code]` (`mypy`),
    `# pyright: ignore[ErrorCode]` (`pyright`), and `# noqa: <ERROR_CODE>`
    (`ruff`). If multiple go on the same line, they should go with `mypy` first.
    Use them only as last resort, when no better solution is available. (An
    example where this is warranted is if `Any` is really the only type that
    works, or if you need to use a third-party library that is not typed.) Some
    pointers on which errors to just comment out are specified below.
  - IMPORTANT! Don't hesitate to over-document. Please ensure that when you
    modify a function, you also update the docstring. If you add a new
    parameter, please document it. Don't forget to put "args", "returns", and
    "raises" in the docstring. THIS IS ONE VERY COMMON LINTING MISTAKE!
  - Check `pyproject.toml` for the max line length. It's probably 80. Yes, the
    formatter will sometimes just reformat the code, but some lines (e.g.
    docstrings) will need to be modified accordingly.
  - The right way to pass a message to an exception is to define a `msg`
    variable, and then pass it to the exception.
  - Put `@final` whenever needed. Helps for type-checking.
  - Put `@override` whenever needed (and it's generally more often than you
    think). Helps for type-checking.
  - Any time you define an empty list, try to type-hint it (e.g.
    `my_list: list[str] = []`).
  - Be mindful of class methods that don't use the `self` parameter. If you
    don't use it, you should make it static.

- **Documentation practices**:
  - Whenever possible, any references to a file or library (or really any piece
    of code) should be surrounded with backticks. Don't say ("we detect
    uv.lock", say "we detect `uv.lock`").
  - **Docstring formatting (Google style)**:
    - In `Returns:` sections, continuation lines must be indented to show they
      belong to the same return description. For example:

      ```python
      Returns:
          The URL with async driver if it was a postgres URL,
              otherwise the original value unchanged.
      ```

    - Use cross-references to link to standard library or third-party docs. The
      syntax is `[`display text`][module.function]`. For example:
      `Uses [`lru_cache`][functools.lru_cache] to ensure...`
    - Available inventories are configured in `mkdocs.yml` under `inventories`.
      Add new ones as needed (e.g., `https://example.com/objects.inv`). Only use
      cross-references if either (1) the function or object is part of the
      standard library, (2) the function or object is part of the current
      library, or (3) is part of an external library but the inventory is in the
      `inventories` section of `mkdocs.yml` or another plugin takes care of it
      (like a `griffe-pydantic` plugin for Pydantic objects.)

  - **Before committing**, run `make doc` to verify spell check passes and docs
    build correctly. Add any new technical terms to `project-words.txt`.

- **Handling linting and type-checking errors** (these are misc notes):
  - In general, if we're dealing with operations that inherently deal with `Any`
    or `Unknown` (e.g. because you're parsing JSON, because you're dealing with
    a third-party library that is not typed, etc.), you can safely put ignore
    comments for: `reportUnknownArgumentType`, `reportUnknownMemberType`,
    `reportUnknownVariableType`, `reportUnknownParameterType`,
    `reportUnknownType`, `reportAny`, `reportExplicitAny`, etc. (`pyright`), and
    `ANN401` (`ruff`).
  - In some cases, you can put `object` as the type, but this is not
    recommended. If you do so, please document why you did it.
