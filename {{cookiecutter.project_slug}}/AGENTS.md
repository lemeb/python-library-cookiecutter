## Orienting Yourself

**A conversation between you and the user can happen at any time during the
implementation process.** It is your job, before doing anything, to figure out
at which stage you are, and potentially ask questions. (Figuring this out might
be very easy if you are, say, a sub-agent assigned to a specific task.)

If you're starting fresh or after a context reset, read this file and determine:

1. What type of request is this? (See "Determining Request Type" below)
2. If implementation: which step of the workflow are you in?
3. What files do you need to load for context?

<!-- Expand here with repo-specific triggers. For example, if using Linear:

## When Given an Issue (e.g., "let's do PROJ-98")

When the user gives you an issue to work on:

1. **Fetch the issue** from your issue tracker
2. **Check blockers** — if blocked, report to user and STOP
3. **Assess the issue state** by checking:
   - Does it have a spec? → If no, you're at step 1
   - Does it have an implementation plan? → If no, you're at step 2
   - Does it have sub-issues for each task? → If no, you're at step 2
   - Is there an incomplete sub-issue? → You're at step 3
4. **Resume at the correct step** — do NOT skip ahead

## Quick Reference

| Action                        | Command                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Auto-fix formatting           | `make check-fix`          |
| Lint + type-check             | `make check`              |
| Strict checks                 | `make check-strict-all`   |
| Run tests                     | `make test`               |
| Tests + coverage              | `make test-with-coverage` |
| All tests (incl. integration) | `make test-all`           |
| Build docs                    | `make doc`                |
| Serve docs locally            | `make doc-serve`          |
| Add dependency                | `uv add <package>`        |
| Add dev dependency            | `uv add --dev <package>`  |

**Before committing**: `make check`, `make check-strict-all`, `make test` (or
`make test-with-coverage`), and `make doc` must all pass. Or just run
`/quality`.

## Skills

Skills automate common workflows. Use them instead of running commands manually.

| Skill      | When to Use                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/check`   | Runs linting and type-checking, fixes errors           |
| `/test`    | Runs tests, writes more if coverage < 100% on new code |
| `/doc`     | Builds docs, fixes spell check, updates nav            |
| `/quality` | Runs all three gates above, reports detailed status    |
| `/go-on`   | Assesses state, executes ONE step, outputs signal      |

**Recommended workflow**:

- **Claude**: Spawn sub-agents for `/check`, `/test`, `/doc` in parallel → then
  `/quality` to verify
- **Codex/Gemini**: Run `/quality` (does everything sequentially)

**For autonomous execution**: `/go-on` determines the current step, loads its
procedure from `dev/workflow/step-*.md`, executes one unit of work, and outputs
a signal (`<STEP_COMPLETE>`, `<AWAITING_APPROVAL>`, `<FEATURE_COMPLETE>`, etc.).
Invoke repeatedly — manually or in a bash loop — to complete a feature.

## Tracker Configuration

<!-- TRACKER: Change the path below to switch trackers.
     Options: dev/tracker/git-local.md, dev/tracker/github.md, dev/tracker/linear.md
     Do NOT remove this comment — it helps with template updates. -->

**Active tracker**: `dev/tracker/git-local.md`

Load this file to understand how to record specs, plans, and track progress. All
workflow steps (`/go-on`, `dev/workflow/step-*.md`) follow the active tracker's
conventions.

## Where to Find Information

| Topic                                 | File                       | When to Load                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Tracker integration**               | See "Active tracker" above | During workflow steps                   |
| Commands, tooling, commit format      | `DEVELOP.md`               | Before committing                       |
| Linting, type-checking, fixing errors | `dev/checking.md`          | Before writing code, when fixing errors |
| Testing practices, coverage           | `dev/testing.md`           | Before writing tests                    |
| Documentation, docstrings             | `dev/documentation.md`     | Before writing code, when writing docs  |
| Python coding practices, dependencies | `dev/python.md`            | Before writing code                     |
| Project structure, usage              | `README.md`                | When exploring codebase                 |
| Python version, line length, deps     | `pyproject.toml`           | Before writing code                     |
| Workflow step details                 | `dev/workflow/step-*.md`   | During `/go-on` or manual workflow      |

**For implementation tasks**: Load `dev/checking.md`, `dev/testing.md`,
`dev/documentation.md`, and `dev/python.md` before writing code.

**For workflow steps**: Each step has detailed procedures in `dev/workflow/`.
The `/go-on` skill loads these automatically, but you can also read them
directly for manual workflow execution. Tracker-specific behavior (where to
record specs, how to track tasks) comes from the active tracker file.

## Determining Request Type

Before starting, classify the request:

| Type               | Examples                                          | Action                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exploration**    | "How does X work?", "Where is Y?", "Explain this" | Answer directly                                               |
| **Quick fix**      | "Fix this typo", "Rename this variable"           | Fix, run `/quality`, commit                                   |
| **Implementation** | "Add feature X", "Implement Y", "Build Z"         | **STOP. Follow workflow from step 1. Do NOT skip to coding.** |
| **Ambiguous**      | "Help me with X", "I need to do Y"                | **Ask which type**                                            |

## The Anatomy of a Feature Implementation

Implementing a feature follows these steps. Each step has detailed procedures in
`dev/workflow/step-*.md`. The `/go-on` skill loads these automatically.

**Key principle**: Each step has gates. Do NOT proceed until gate conditions are
met.

### Step Overview

| Step        | Goal                                                | Details                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1. Spec     | Understand the feature, write spec                  | `dev/workflow/step-1-spec.md`     |
| 2. Plan     | Break down into tasks, get approval                 | `dev/workflow/step-2-plan.md`     |
| 3. Task     | Implement ONE task (code + test + quality + commit) | `dev/workflow/step-3-task.md`     |
| 4. Ship     | Create PR                                           | `dev/workflow/step-4-ship.md`     |
| 5. Feedback | Address review comments                             | `dev/workflow/step-5-feedback.md` |
| 6. Cleanup  | Post-merge cleanup                                  | `dev/workflow/step-6-cleanup.md`  |

**Step 3 is the inner loop**: Repeat for each task in the plan. Each iteration
does ONE task completely (code → tests → quality → commit) before moving to the
next.

### Quick Summary

1. **Spec** (Step 1): Explore codebase, clarify requirements, write spec
2. **Plan** (Step 2): Design approach, break into small self-contained tasks,
   get user approval before proceeding
3. **Task** (Step 3, repeats): For each task:
   - Pick next incomplete task
   - Load `dev/*.md` guidance
   - Implement code + tests + docs
   - Run `/quality`
   - Commit
   - Mark task done
4. **Ship** (Step 4): Create PR with complete description
5. **Feedback** (Step 5): Address review comments
6. **Cleanup** (Step 6): Delete branch, update tracker

### Critical Rules

- **Never skip to coding** without a plan and approval
- **Each task is self-contained**: code + tests + docs in one commit
- **Run `/quality` before every commit**
- **Work on a feature branch**, not the base branch

### Claude-specific Notes (ignore if Codex or Gemini)

**After context reset**: Context is cleared after Plan Mode approval or
conversation compaction. If you detect you're mid-workflow (e.g., plan file
exists, tracker has tasks in progress), run `/go-on` as your first action to
re-orient and continue.

**Task tracking** (Step 3): Use `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` to track progress
through tasks. This allows hand-off if a session ends mid-implementation.

**Parallel execution**: For independent tasks, spawn sub-agents (2-3 max). Each
sub-agent handles a complete task including tests and quality.

**Quality checks**: Spawn sub-agents for `/check`, `/test`, `/doc` in parallel,
then run `/quality` yourself to verify. Sub-agents should prefer `make` targets
over raw commands.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                             | What You Should Do Instead                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Skipping to implementation without a plan           | Complete Step 2, get user approval FIRST             |
| Not breaking down tasks                             | Each task should be small and self-contained         |
| Structuring as "code, then tests, then docs"        | Each task includes its own tests and docs            |
| Implementing entire feature at once                 | Step 3 does ONE task per invocation                  |
| Forgetting to re-run quality gates after sub-agents | Run `/quality` yourself after parallel work          |
| Not running `make test-with-coverage`               | Always run with coverage before committing           |
| Using raw commands (npx, pytest, ruff) naively      | Prefer `make` targets; raw OK sparingly              |
| Committing all uncommitted code as one big commit   | One task = one commit (roughly)                      |
| Not outputting signals in `/go-on`                  | Always end with `<STEP_COMPLETE>`, `<BLOCKED>`, etc. |
